The Manhattan distance directly correlates with the puzzle's movement rules, accurately reflecting the minimum moves needed since only vertical or horizontal movements are allowed. In contrast, the Euclidean distance, which measures the straight-line distance, implies the possibility of diagonal movement. This makes it a less accurate estimate for the puzzle because it slightly underestimates the true cost compared to Manhattan distance, leading to a broader exploration of the state space. Thus, while Euclidean distance provides a better estimate than simply counting misplaced tiles, it doesn't match the efficiency of the Manhattan distance, which more tightly conforms to the puzzle's constraints."

This is because the heuristic remains admissible—it never overestimates the actual minimum cost to reach the goal.
